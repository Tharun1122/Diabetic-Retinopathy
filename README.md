# Diabetic-Retinopathy
A Deep Learning based Model to assess the presence and severity of retinal conditions due to Diabetes.
Diabetic retinopathy (DR), also known as diabetic eye disease, is a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus. It is a leading cause of blindness. Diabetic retinopathy affects up to 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more. Diabetic retinopathy often has no early warning signs. Retinal (fundus) photography with manual interpretation is a widely accepted screening tool for diabetic retinopathy, with performance that can exceed that of in-person dilated eye examinations.
Detection of diabetic retinopathy with CNNs, notably ResNet, utilizes deep learning to automatically recognize signs of retinal damage associated with the disease. Trained on extensive datasets of retinal images, CNNs learn intricate features indicative of diabetic retinopathy, such as microaneurysms and hemorrhages, across various severity levels. The network architecture typically comprises multiple layers that progressively process retinal images, extracting features at different abstraction levels. This enables CNNs to discern subtle differences between healthy and diseased retinas, facilitating accurate diagnosis.Deep learning offers advantages over traditional methods by automatically learning relevant features from data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. 
Once trained, CNNs like ResNet are computationally efficient, suitable for real-time application in clinical settings. Rapid and precise diabetic retinopathy detection is critical for early intervention and treatment, mitigating the risk of vision loss and improving patient outcomes. In summary, deep learning-based approaches, particularly CNNs such as ResNet, provide an effective means of detecting diabetic retinopathy, leveraging the power of data-driven feature learning for timely diagnosis and intervention.
